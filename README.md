Disparity feels like motion that isn’t evenly shared. Heavy facts, deadlines, and priorities act like weight, pulling nearby paths while things farther away drift more freely. A small push near that weight can change direction a lot, while far away the pull fades. The visual is simple and steady, but it shows imbalance as curves and shifts in speed. By adjusting the weight, I can see how focus, bias, or workload changes the flow. It’s a clear way to show uneven influence: when disparity grows, the grid bends and paths warp. In the end, it’s also a cheap reminder of the steady patterns of professional life. 

(No this means absolutely nothing, I'm just learning front end development.)
